# Python-Gravity-Simulation

This is an advanced orbital dynamics and n-body simulation program.
Through simple rules of physics complex and beautiful behaviours can occur.

The main file is "UI with solar system.py" wich has to be run  to be started.
SolarSystem.py and BarnesHut.py supplies the program with functions.

The Barnes hut algorythm is highly optimised for many bodies and 
makes larger scale n body simulations possible.

Any help or assistance is greatly appreciated.
