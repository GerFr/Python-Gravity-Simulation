# Python-Gravity-Simulation

This is an advanced orbital dynamics and n-body simulation program.
Through simple rules of physics complex and beautiful behaviours can occur.

The main file is `main.py` wich has to be run  to be started.
`SolarSystem.py` and `BarnesHut.py` supplies the program with functions.

The Barnes hut algorythm is highly optimised for many bodies and 
makes larger scale n-body simulations possible.

Example runs can be found at YouTube [here](https://youtube.com/@physimdev).

Any help or assistance is greatly appreciated.
Kindly share this project!

# Planned features

1.) clicking on objects

2.) data handling with json



**possible features:**

placing objects

ui package 

please ask for features in [discussions](https://github.com/PhySimdev/Python-Gravity-Simulation/discussions)!

# Installation guide
1.) download the code from github (either with .zip or git pull/clone)

2.) install requirements.txt
This can be done with the command 

`py -m pip install -r requirements.txt` 
  using cmd in the directory of the code.

A python installation is also needed.

# Running the code
Run the file main.py either from the file explorer, an IDE or CMD/shell.

# Tweakables
There are easily exchangeable variables in the init function of the Interface class in the "UI with solar system.py". 
Possible options include a barnes hut overlay or random planet system generation rather than the solar system.
