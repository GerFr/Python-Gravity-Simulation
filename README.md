# Python-Gravity-Simulation

This is an advanced orbital dynamics and n-body simulation program.
Through simple rules of physics complex and beautiful behaviours can occur.

The main file is "UI with solar system.py" wich has to be run  to be started.
SolarSystem.py and BarnesHut.py supplies the program with functions.

The Barnes hut algorythm is highly optimised for many bodies and 
makes larger scale n body simulations possible.

Any help or assistance is greatly appreciated.
Kindly share this project!

# Installation guide
1.) download the code from github (either with .zip or git pull/clone)
2.) install requirements.txt
This can be done with the command <py -m pip install -r requirements.txt> using cmd in the directory of the code.
A python installation is also needed.

# Running the code
Run the file "UI with solar system.py" either from the file explorer, an IDE or CMD/shell.

# Tweakables
There are easily exchangeable variables in the init function of the Interface class in the "UI with solar system.py". 
Possible options include a barnes hut overlay or random planet system generation rather than solar system.
